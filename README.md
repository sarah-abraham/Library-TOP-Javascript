# Library - The Odin Project Javascript Course
This web page can be used to add books into the Library using the form in the sidebar, this will lead to a card being displayed on the web page with the details of the book. There is also a delete button on the card that can be used to delete the book from the Library. Objects in Javascript were explored through this project.
